# RFM Tier 5 Demos â€“ Emotional Physics in Action

This repository contains five interactive demo projects showcasing the Tier 5 capabilities of the PUTMAN Model's **Resonant Field Mapping (RFM)** system. Each demo progressively adds features for emotionally intelligent interaction, symbolic overlays, and dynamic tone modulation â€” culminating in Demo 5, where user-controlled emotional states shape NPC-style memory and visual resonance.

## ðŸ”¥ Whatâ€™s This About?

This series is part of a larger vision to transform how digital systems handle **emotion, meaning, and memory**. Using color-based tone fields, affective arousal meters, and symbolic overlays, these demos bring abstract emotional dynamics into vivid, trackable form.

Â¡Get ready for more emotion!
